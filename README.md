# Diabetes Prediction Using Deep Learning Algorithms
## This project was done as a part of deep learning course 10 percent mark. 
## Abstract:
Nowadays, Diabetes is the most common disease in humans. People having diabetes have a high risk of other diseases such as heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, etc. Therefore, Early-stage prediction of diabetes has significant importance in the health sector.  This study aims to create a clinical support system that will help to diagnose diabetes disease at the primary stage. In this study, We have proposed a model to predict diabetes disease more accurately using Build the RNN Model (LSTM with Dropout).

## Dataset
We have collected datasets from Kaggle. The diabetes dataset contains 768 instances. Each instance has 9 features.

## Methodology
After the collection of the dataset, I applied the following steps to build deep learning models and predict accuracy.

We have evaluated deep learning models trained with algorithms such as RNN Model (LSTM with Dropout) algorithm to predict diabetes.  
The outcomes of the experiment are shown in the result section. 

## Results
We have applied multiple deep learning algorithms to predict diabetes. For evaluation of the model, we have considered cross validation result, test score, precision, recall and F1 score. According to these parameters, we have found that RNN Model (LSTM with Dropout) model is the winner. It provides highest accuracy (best cv score and test score) for diabetes prediction. 
For diabetes prediction, RNN Model (LSTM with Dropout) model gives 77% accuracy in cross validation (10-Fold CV)   and 77% accuracy in test result. 

## Conclusions:
In this study, deep learning algorithms are applied to the datasets and the classification has been done using algorithms of which RNN Model (LSTM with Dropout) gives the highest accuracy of 77% for diabetes prediction. 
Clearly, our deep-learning models can predict diabetes disease at the primary stage. It will definitely help in the diagnosis of diseases early and will increase the chance of recovery. Further, this study can be extended to find how likely non-diabetic at present can have the risk of diabetes in the next few years.
